type 
npm install in the terminal (being inside the folder in which we are working)
to get a package.json and be able to install packages
    then we install a terminal that will allow us to keep the js file updated according to the changes in ts file
    npm install --save-dev lite-server

in the package.json
change:
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
to:
    "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "lite-server"
  },
 
then type npm start in the terminal to keep the server going and be able to run the code 
in localhost
